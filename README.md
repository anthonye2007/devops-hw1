### Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
Microsoft Azure is a competitor to Amazon Web Services with comparable services.  Azure allows users to launch servers (either Windows servers or Linux servers) very quickly, either from the web console or through API calls.  There are a wide variety of servers available, ranging from a VM with a single core with 0.75 GB RAM and 20GB disk drive for $0.018/hr to a VM with 32 cores, 448 GB RAM, and over 6 TB disk drive for $8.69/hr.  Azure offers different categories of servers, each of which optimizes for one of cost, configuration flexibility, compute speed, and network speed.  Azure allows VMs to be launched with images from a community gallery, so single app servers may already be configured for users.
